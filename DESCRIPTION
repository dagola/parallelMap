Package: parallelMap
Title: Unified Interface to Parallelization Back-Ends
Description: Unified parallelization framework for multiple back-end,
    designed for internal package and interactive usage.
    The main operation is parallel mapping over lists.
    Supports 'local', 'multicore', 'mpi' and 'BatchJobs' mode.
    Allows tagging of the parallel operation
    with a level name that can be later selected by the user to
    switch on parallel execution for exactly this operation.
