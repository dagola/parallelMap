\usage{
parallelGetRegisteredLevels(flatten = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{flatten}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Flatten to character vector or not? See description.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
[code{RegisteredLevels} | \code{character}]. See above.

\description{
With \code{flatten = FALSE}, a structured S3 object is returned.
The S3 object only has one slot, which is called \code{levels}.
This contains a named list. Each name refers to \code{package} from the call to
\code{\link{parallelRegisterLevels}}, while the entries are character
vectors of the form \dQuote{package.level}.
With \code{flatten = TRUE}, a simple character vector is returned that contains all
concatenated entries of \code{levels} from above.
