\title{Source R files for parallelization.}
\usage{
parallelSource(..., files, master = TRUE, level = NA_character_,
  show.info = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{[\code{character}]\cr
File paths to sources.}

\item{files}{[\code{character}]\cr
File paths to sources.
Alternative way to pass arguments.}

\item{master}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Source files also on master for any mode?
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{level}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
If a (non-missing) level is specified in \code{\link{parallelStart}},
the function only sources the files if the level specified here matches.
See \code{\link{parallelMap}}.
Useful if this function is used in a package.
Default is \code{NA}.}

\item{show.info}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Verbose output on console?
Can be used to override setting from options / \code{\link{parallelStart}}.
Default is NA which means no overriding.}
}
\value{
Nothing.
}
\description{
Makes sure that the files are sourced in slave process so that they can be used in a job
function which is later run with \code{\link{parallelMap}}.

For all modes, the files are also (potentially) loaded on the master.
